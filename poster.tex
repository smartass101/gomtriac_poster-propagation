  \begin{itemize}
  \item A course focused on basic understanding of experimental tokamak physics and control
  \item For undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in experimental tokamak physics
  \item Participants do not need to leave their country to get experienced in tokamak operation. They can participate even from their home
  \item \textsc{gomtraic} 2012 starts on March, 6th and finishes three months later, on May, 30th 2012
  \item Participants will address 9 tasks from basic tokamak physics and technology
